# Go Speedtest

A network speed testing application built on top of Ookla's SpeedTest CLI tooling. Also supports weather gathering(for satellite Wi-Fi users).

## Motivation

Satellite internet is subject to environmental factors like weather.
I'm building this tool to help better understand the consequences of things like weather on network speed.

## Backend
Uses a simple SQLite backend.
